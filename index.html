                    I created this project during an internship at Zooka Creative, a marketing
                    agency. While I had some smaller projects I worked on at Zooka as well, my
                    biggest focus was creating a few types of in-store displays for an upcoming
                    launch of a solar business for a major company. One display was designed to be
                    thin and manned by an employee and it gave me my first taste of working with a
                    client and their project constraints. When designing this within Rhino, I went
                    through dozens of designs in a very short period of time.
                </p>
                <img
                    src="img/4-3.png"
                    class="float-end ms-3 mb-2"
                    width="100%"
                    style="max-width: 900px"
                />
                <p>
                    When going through this process, I made sure to have at least the prior few
                    iterations available at all times, as well as their individual components. This
                    not only enabled me to iterate off of the previous design very easily, but I
                    also was able to grab components from prior designs if I ended up preferring
                    them after all. The second display was more involved and larger, although many
                    of the specific decisions, such as creating a model home, were my own. I went
                    through a similar process as I did with the first design, although I received
                    feedback more often since the design was more involved. The first prototype that
                    I showed off to the client in a meeting was lauded by not only the client, but
                    the rest of my Zooka co-workers. Out of all of the designs shown to the client,
                    mine was selected to be further developed into a full product.

                <p>
                    I continued to develop the prototype on my own as well as work with our content
                    team to add graphics and make appropriate changes to make the display more
                    “store ready”. This involved creating a blueprint that included not only the
                    design at all angles, but an “unfolded” iteration. Although I concluded my
                    internship at Zooka before the project was completed, I last heard that my
                    prototype was intended to be produced into a full model and displayed at the
                    client’s headquarters.

                    During my junior year at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, I was given the
                    opportunity to design something on my own with very few restrictions. I wasn't
                    exactly sure in what space I'd be working, but I knew that I wanted it to
                    involve a controller or handheld device so I could see if they were as enjoyable
                    to design as I hoped they would be. With this in mind, after eight months of on
                    and off work, I created <em>Ludo Learn</em>. <em>Ludo Learn</em> is a system
                    that enables "enhanced education", learning beyond the classroom, in low income,
                    low infrastructure areas.

                <p>
                    Before even beginning work on the design, I did particularly extensive research
                    on educational software and “edutainment”. A large part of this was creating a
                    survey that I sent out to multiple middle school teachers who then shared it
                    with their students, getting hundreds of responses as a result, all of which
                    helped guide my design going forward.

                    The hardware went through a few major iterations, with the first couple focusing
                    on putting the functionality of a mouse within the form factor of a handheld. I
                    did this since I wanted it to feel less like a video game system and closer to a
                    traditional computer, but after user feedback and testing, I focused more on the
                    overall shape of the design and only the most important ways the user would
                    interact with the device.

                <img src="img/5-5.jpg" class="float-end ms-3" width="275px" />
                <p>
                    Throughout the process, I was slowly self-learning some basic electronic skills
                    that would enable me to get the hardware to interface with the software for my
                    final prototype, and after getting the right components and connecting them
                    together in the correct way, I had a fully functioning handheld device.
                    Alongside a friend, I developed some basic software that could run on the device
                    and be demoed, giving a clear picture of what the device would be like.

                    Another project from Summer 2024 was to create a gasket cover with one goal in
                    mind: precision. Since gasket covers can be used in a wide array of mechanical
                    designs, including some where errors of a fraction of a millimeter matter,
                    ensuring that the otherwise simple gasket cover has the exact dimensions needed
                    is of the utmost importance. I began by taking a multitude of measurements from
                    the gasket using a caliper, making sure to take each measurement a few times to
                    ensure accuracy. I then created a sketch primarily to note all of my
                    measurements, especially since if I got all of the measurements right, I
                    technically wouldn't even need the sketch, but of course I created one anyway
                    just to keep everything straight.
                </p>
                <img src="img/6-4.png" class="float-end ms-3 mb-2" width="270px" />
                <img src="img/6-3.png" class="float-end ms-3 mb-2" width="225px" />
                <p>
                    I was then able to quickly create a sketch in Solidworks of the gasket cover.
                    After finishing the CAD sketch, I used GibbsCAM to prepare the part for
                    machining in BU's EPIC.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Almost immediately after milling the first iteration, I knew something was
                    wrong. I quickly discovered that the holes on the sides were significantly
                    misaligned. This seemed to have something to do with the radius/centering of the
                    circles due to the distance of the misalignment.
                </p>
                <img src="img/6-5.png" class="float-start me-3 mb-2" width="225px" />
                <img src="img/6-6.jpg" class="float-end ms-3 mb-2" width="225px" />
                <p>
                    After noticing my blunder, I quickly corrected the error within the CAD model
                    and returned to EPIC to mill another cover. While this second iteration
                    initially seemed to fit correctly, I later found out I had made two small yet
                    important errors. Firstly, I had made the diameter of the larger circles
                    slightly larger than they were supposed to be. Secondly, when I was correcting
                    the spacing of the side holes, I had still left them slightly too close to each
                    other.
                </p>
                <img src="img/6-7.png" class="float-end ms-3" width="225px" />
                <p>
                    After taking further measurements and making the necessary modifications, I
                    milled a third and thankfully final iteration of the gasket cover. Overall,
                    considering the speed at which this was completed and accuracy by the end, I
                    think this was a fairly successful project. That being said, it became clear to
                    me that measuring the gasket multiple times wasn't enough, and I should have
                    additionally focused on checking the measurements at each stage of the process,
                    since they may have been recreated slightly incorrectly at one stage in the
                    process and never noticed until it was too late.

                    This class project took place over seven weeks, and had a very specific goal: To
                    design a set of three objects which will help prevent burns from coffee spills
                    in the style of designer Joe Colombo. The combination of the COVID-19 lockdown
                    occurring in the middle of this project, as well as my working with a partner
                    for this particular project, resulted in an interesting change of pace compared
                    to my previous design work up to this point. My partner and I were already
                    locked down in our separate homes by the time we created our first physical
                    prototypes, so we could only use pictures to show one another our concepts. We
                    worked on a lid, cup, and coaster combo set that would minimize coffee burns. My
                    partner worked mainly on the cup, and I worked on the other two components, the
                    lid and the coaster.

                <p>
                    In the first iteration, I failed to show one of the key features of the lid
                    component, the liquid retrieval/guard system, and this resulted in subpar
                    feedback from our peers. After this setback, I decided to take a 3D model
                    approach sooner than I had planned, and this was the right call. Despite the
                    much more positive feedback from our peers regarding this second iteration, a
                    change arose that would need to be made to the lid which would require the
                    entire lid to be remade, not just modified or copied. After about an hour, I
                    managed to perfectly replicate the lid and make the change that was needed. This
                    project allowed me to expand and show my proficiency with the Rhino CAD
                    software, especially my ability to relate new aspects of a model to the older
                    ones. This was not only demonstrated when I replicated the lid perfectly, but
                    also when I had to fit the coaster and lid around the cup, which had been made
                    separately from the other two components.
