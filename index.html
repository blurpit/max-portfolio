        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>Throughout the majority of my life, I have known that I wanted to create. When I was younger, I thought that
            being an “inventor” was a legitimate occupation. I eventually realized this was not the case, but soon
            learned about the career of product design, and I’ve stuck with it for the years since then. Because of
            this, since I started college at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and because of the increased presence of
            design in my life while there, I’ve been able to begin to narrow down what I enjoy designing the most. One
            particular product that has fascinated me more and more is the video game controller. They are interesting,
            in that they have to be able to control thousands of unique games, and yet be simple and comfortable enough
            for anyone to understand and use long term. Another more general area I like to work in is with products
            that are multi-purpose. To elaborate, I enjoy working on products that have multiple functions or forms,
            that work together to achieve their own smaller goals, as well as a larger goal, such as my SwitchStand. I
            also dual major with business management. While I consider product design my primary interest, I’ve been
            able to take advantage of skills learned from my business courses, such as marketing and human-focused
            analysis, and apply them to my design work. While I’m fully capable at the entire design process, I consider
            my strengths to be 3D modeling, rapid prototyping, and being able to make changes on the fly. In the future,
            I hope not only to hone in on my pre-existing skills, but develop new skills that will give me an even
            greater understanding of the design process and continue to develop more real-world products. The following
            “slices” of my portfolio highlight a portion of my work within design over the past 4 years.</p>

        </figure>
        <p>My most recent project was during an internship at Zooka Creative, a marketing agency. While I had some
            smaller projects I worked on there as well, my biggest focus was creating a few versions of in-store
            displays for the at the time upcoming launch of a solar division for a major company. One display was
            designed to be thin and manned by an employee, and it gave me my first taste of working with a client and
            their project constraints.</p>

        <p>The second display was more involved and larger, although many of the specific
            decisions, such as creating a model home, were my own. The first prototype that I showed off to the client
            in a meeting was lauded by not only the client, but the rest of my Zooka co-workers. Out of all of the
            designs shown off, mine was selected to be further developed into a full product. I continued to develop the
            prototype on my own, as well as work with our content team to add graphics and make some changes to make it
            more “store ready”. This included creating a “blueprint” that included not only the design at all angles,
            but While I concluded my internship at Zooka before the project was completed, I last heard that my
            prototype was intended to be produced into a full model and displayed at their headquarters.</p>

        <p>
            During my junior year at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, I was given the opportunity to design something
            on my own with very few restrictions. I wasn't exactly sure what space I'd be working in, but I knew that I
            had to have it involve a controller or handheld device, so I could see if they were enjoyable to design as I
            hoped they would be. After 8 months of on and off work, I have my personal favorite project to work on so
            far, Ludo Learn. Ludo Learn is a system that enables "enhanced education", learning beyond the classroom, in
            low income and low infrastructure areas. The hardware of Ludo Learn in its current state is a handheld
            system that uses interchangeable cartridges for different kinds of educational software. The design of the
            handheld and cartridges enable the handheld to be very affordable, and while the cartridges will be more
            expensive, they will be rented or "checked out" like in a library. This will occur in the "Connect Center",
            which is a mobile center that not only enables the core idea, but other functions as well, such as
            peer-to-peer connectivity. Working on this project resulted in learning a plethora of skills, including some
            electronics skills and software skills, mainly due to just how long I was able to work on it and more
            importantly, advance the design. I even collaborated with some friends to create a software demo as well as
            iron out some of the kinks in the functioning prototype. The project has also solidified my interest in
            designing controllers, as my favorite part of working on Ludo Learn so far has been creating the handheld
            itself.</p>

        </figure>
        <p>This project took place over 7 weeks, and had a very specific goal: To design a set of three objects that
            will help prevent burns from coffee, in the style of designer Joe Colombo. The combination of the COVID-19
            lockdown occurring in the middle of this project, as well as working with a partner for this particular
            project, resulted in an interesting change of pace compared to previous designs. We were already locked down
            in our separate homes by the time we created our first physical prototypes, so we could only use pictures to
            show our concepts. We worked on a lid, cup, and coaster combo set that would minimize coffee burns, with my
            partner mainly working on the cup, and I worked on the other two components. In the first iteration, I
            failed to show one of the key features of the lid component, the liquid retrieval/guard system, and this
            resulted in subpar feedback. After this setback, I decided to take a 3D model approach sooner than I had
            planned, and this was the right call. Despite the much more positive feedback from this second iteration, a
            change that would need to be made to the lid would require the entire lid to be remade, not just modified or
            copied. After about an hour, I managed to perfectly replicate the lid and make the change that was needed.
            This project allowed me to expand and show my proficiency with the Rhino CAD software, especially my ability
            to connect new aspects of a model to the older ones. This was not only shown off when I replicated the lid
            perfectly, but also when I had to fit the coaster and lid around the cup, which had been made entirely
            separately from the other two components.</p>

        </figure>
        <p>This specific project had a 4 week time frame, in which we had to design a product to be used by students in
            the design studio space at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Since the product being designed was to be used
            by those designing it, that made the process easier and harder. Harder, because I had a fairly small sample
            size of people who I had to design for, but it was also easier since I could observe what issues people
            seemed to be having right in front of me, and design based off of that. I observed a general issue regarding
            organization, and worked off of that, until I created a version similar to my final design, but without any
            of the transformation.</p>
        <figure class="figure ms-3 float-end">

        </figure>
        <p>When I presented my pin-ups to some peers, they misinterpreted one of my drawings as
            a folding mechanism, and I realized the benefits of this possibility, and decided to continue with the same
            general form, but now with a folding in half feature. Once this version was shown off, another peer
            suggested that I make the entire module collapsible. Initially, I passed this off as impossible, but I
            decided to draw out some ideas for how this would work, and after about a day of testing, realized it was
            physically possible, and got to work. I repurposed door hinges and a lot of tape, amongst other
            unconventional methods, and I managed to put together a fully collapsible prototype. This project in
            particular tested my material resourcefulness and ability to expand upon the current version of a design,
            while still keeping the core concept intact and not needing to do a serious revision.

            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>For this project, I was given the prompt of designing for play. This was intentionally broad, so instead of
            going with a more traditional meaning, I decided to focus on playing with musical instruments. Considering
            my time constraints (one week) , I knew that I would have to 3D print to get a working design in the time
            period, so I made sure from the start to work in a smaller space, as well as solidifying a core idea, that I
            would try to stick to, unless it needed to be significantly changed for any reason. This resulted in the
            SoundBox, a practice device that can be used percussively and can have its pitch modified. The time
            constraints meant that I would only have one attempt at a revised model after my first prototype, so I made
            sure to apply as much feedback as possible, without going too far away from the core concept. Despite some
            modeling challenges, and some work after hours, I was able to create a second iteration that fixed all of
            the major issues with the first iteration. After all was said and done, amongst all of the participants with
            the same prompt and constraints, I managed to get the only working prototype after the five days. The
            process I used here, combined with my time dedication, has allowed me to work flow with my designs to be
            efficient and effective.</p>
