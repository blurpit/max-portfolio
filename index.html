                    Hi, I’m Max! I’m currently a masters student at Boston University where I am
                    studying Product Design and Manufacture. I was previously at Rensselaer
                    Polytechnic Institute where I earned a dual B.S. in Design, Innovation, Society
                    & Business Management. I hope you enjoy viewing my portfolio where I showcase my
                    skills in design thinking, prototyping, CAD, and more.

                <p>
                    For the course “Advanced Product Design”, a two semester course, three teammates
                    and I were tasked with designing a product that would solve an issue within a
                    broad subject area, in our case travel. After a couple of brainstorming
                    sessions, we came up with three very different concepts, one of which was a
                    “modular” suitcase. This design would let you switch out different components to
                    suit specific situations, and we decided to go forward with this concept. We
                    sent out a survey that had a multitude of questions about what potential
                    customers might want in their suitcase, and we received about 150 responses.
                    From this information, one thing that stuck out was that a large number of
                    respondents wanted the ability to change the size of the suitcase. We added this
                    as a pipe dream since we hadn’t figured out what this even meant, but this data
                    point stuck out all the same. We ended up deciding to fully focus on a size
                    changing design, and began figuring out not only how to make it work, but if it
                    even could work.
                </p>

                    <img src="img/Suitcase-3.png" class="ms-1" width="85%" />
                </div>
                <p>
                    After doing some calculations to determine what physical (applied force and
                    scale) constraints we had to work with, we began working out a design that would
                    allow a suitcase to go from a carry on to checked size in a matter of seconds.
                    This process took a couple months of sketching, challenging our designs, mocking
                    them up in OnShape, and repeating. We eventually found a design that not only
                    functioned, but would allow the user to do the expansion/contraction with just
                    one movement. From this core, we created a series of CAD models that could be
                    used to simulate the entire motion of the system. From the final iteration of
                    the model for the fall semester, we created a package of blueprints containing
                    about 100 individual drawings.

                <p>
                    In the spring semester, our primary objective was to develop a physical
                    prototype, as well as make any refinements as needed. I was tasked with both
                    improving and creating the handle. On a regular suitcase, this may seem
                    relatively straightforward, but because our design expands, so too does our
                    handle. The design that had been created in the fall, while functional, had a
                    large number of components, some of which we hadn’t realized would be difficult
                    to either manufacture and/or fit together. I decided to kill two birds with one
                    stone by not only drastically reducing the part count while keeping the function
                    near identical, but redesigning the components such that they could all easily
                    either slide into each other or screw into each other during assembly. This
                    required numerous revisions and 3D printed test parts to ensure everything
                    physically worked with each other. Eventually, we had a fully working handle as
                    well as a fully working half-scale prototype of the entire suitcase. This used a
                    combination of 3D printed parts, different adhesives, and thermoformed
                    polycarbonate to realistically simulate the full sized model as much as
                    possible. We finally created a new set of blueprints to reflect the changes,
                    this time only needing 70 pages.

                    After the semester, one of my teammates and I realized that we had a unique
                    design that could solve multiple issues travelers face with their suitcases, and
                    we didn’t want to just abandon the project. Since May 2025, we’ve been working
                    on bringing this product to market. To do this, we did extensive customer
                    research to verify our assumptions, primarily through customer interviews. We
                    conducted about 10 interviews over Zoom with people who had left their emails on
                    our fall survey, or people who had been recommended by previous interviewees. We
                    conducted an additional 24 interviews by giving out free lemonade during the
                    July 4th weekend at the Boston Common, which enabled us to reach a wider and
                    more diverse audience. From the data gathered from these interviews, we’ve been
                    able to conclude soundly that there’s a significant market for our design. We
                    have also been working with lawyers to patent the design. Our next steps will be
                    to work out a fleshed out business plan and to finalize the patent so we can
                    begin getting investors and finding companies to work with on bringing the
                    suitcase to life.

                    For the graduate course “Product Realization”, teams of four were tasked with
                    creating a simple design that could be mass produced, an element that was tested
                    as we had to create 13 copies of the product. Additionally, extensive document
                    creation and control was required for the entire project. Our group ended up
                    creating a “ratchet calendar”, a rolling calendar that makes a satisfying
                    clicking noise every time a roller is moved. While I did help with the
                    development of the design and worked on some of its construction, focusing
                    particularly on the wooden base, my main job was document management. Over the
                    course of the semester, I not only managed and enforced our Enterprise Data
                    Management document, but maintained every single document as to remain
                    consistent with each other and to have accurate, up to date information. Part of
                    this was done through having a clearly defined style guide that I could use and
                    make sure my teammates used, but it was also partially just constantly checking
                    each document, and checking even more frequently as deadlines approached. This
                    experience was a great simulation of a realistic design process, particularly
                    due to the focus on the documentation. I was surprised that I ended up enjoying
                    and thriving in this environment, and believe that I handled our documentation
                    management exceptionally, as indicated by our team receiving the on-average
                    highest scores for each documentation checkpoint out of the entire class.

                    During a product design course I took in Summer 2024, I was tasked with
                    designing a 3D Printed, custom designed device that has 2.5 degrees of movement
                    freedom. My team of three quickly determined that we wanted to create a device
                    that could play a musical instrument known as a "Stylophone". The stylophone is
                    a small piano-like device that uses a pen with a metal tip, wired to the
                    Stylophone, to play electronic notes. We concluded that the pen already being
                    part of the Stylophone would ensure that it would work well as long as we could
                    get it to move around correctly, and that making a device that could play a
                    physical instrument just sounded like fun. We first sketched what a singular,
                    modular linear actuator would look like, primarily to get measurements down.
                    Then, we created a sketch of what we envisioned the entire unit to look like,
                    making sure to add some extra supports so the unit could remain stable.

                    Our next goal was to perfect a single linear actuator that would then be
                    replicated to create the three actuators of the final device. Our first
                    iteration functioned fine but would go through numerous iterations, whether that
                    be due to changing the rod thickness, adjusting the heights of the two ends, or
                    accounting for how everything needed to connect to one another. Each group
                    member designed a component for this stage, with my component being the
                    carriage. The biggest hurdle was designing the "teeth" that would allow it to
                    connect to the belt. After a long period of time designing in Solidworks and a
                    quick 3D print, I verified that the belt fit into the teeth perfectly. When I
                    was designing the carriage, I made it as basic as possible intentionally since I
                    knew that even once I got one that simply "worked", I was going to have to
                    iterate it continuously to fit within the other components around it changing.
                    This paid off, since I ended up creating about ten separate versions of the
                    carriage during our ideation process, most of which added on to prior versions,
                    although some had components removed, which was also made easier by the more
                    straightforward design.

                    After we ideated upon the actuator multiple times, we eventually came to a
                    design that we liked that would be able to work for all of the required
                    functions. Once we assembled the "frame", we knew it was time to make a
                    component that could hold the Arduino, and a component that could hold the
                    Stylophone. I ended up designing these, and took a similar approach to both. The
                    major change I had to make for the Stylophone version was how I printed it, as
                    it was slightly too large to fit on the print bed. To remedy this, I cut the
                    unit in half and printed each half separately, and we just made sure to lock it
                    in place in the device so that the different halves were unnoticeable.

                <p>
                    At this point, we had a near final design but there were two critical issues
                    that we needed to address. Firstly, the Arduino code was just not working. We
                    were usually able to move some part of the device, but never in the way we
                    wanted it to. This would result in multiple meetings dedicated to just working
                    through the code, bouncing ideas off of each other, and slowly but surely moving
                    towards the Stylophone Player, well, playing the Stylophone. The other issue was
                    the Stylophone pen, which was using both an extended tip and hot glue tread for
                    the motor to latch onto to enable it to move up and down. This initially seemed
                    to work, but we quickly realized that this either didn't latch on in the first
                    place, or slowly degraded over time. We continued to recreate the hot glue
                    tread, but time and time again, it would quickly fail. After a while, we
                    realized that we needed something that would be consistent. We realized that
                    since the belt moved perfectly along the motor, that means if we re-created the
                    teeth from the carriage, it should fit. I was tasked with creating this new
                    extension, since I had the most knowledge regarding the teeth, but it was still
                    a difficult task, as I didn't have the CAD sketch anymore that I used for the
                    carriage, so I had to recreate them from scratch. After a thankfully shorter
                    process than the initial teeth, I managed to make a new extension piece that
                    worked perfectly.
                </p>
                <img src="img/Stylophone-11.jpg" class="float-end ms-3 mb-2" width="500px" />
                <p>
                    With this, the hardware of the Stylophone Player was complete. We first had it
                    play a "chromatic scale", or a scale that just plays every note in order. This
                    took a lot more trial and error than expected, as we learned that when variables
                    such as speed changed, the device would become less precise and in turn, hit the
                    wrong keys. Eventually, we fixed this simply by "honing in" on coordinates that
                    would work no matter the speed. We then programmed in "The Imperial March" from
                    the Star Wars franchise. When making the code, we designed it so that once we
                    determined the correct coordinates, we could just enter the notes we wanted to
                    play, and it should play them in that order. At this point, we encountered an
                    odd error involving the pen pushing too hard down on the Stylophone, but just
                    for the first note. We eventually figured out it was determining the
                    Z-coordinates (how high up it was) incorrectly and that we had basically just
                    gotten lucky for the chromatic scale, so we fixed this for both songs.

                    I am happy with how this project turned out and would consider it a success. We
                    set out to create a device that could play a Stylophone by itself, and we
                    accomplished exactly that. I learned a lot of valuable lessons from this
                    project, especially since it was incredibly involved and hands on. I improved my
                    CAD/Solidworks workflow, gained a much better understanding of electronic wiring
                    and Arduino, further understood the strengths and limits of 3D printing, and
                    improved my modular design thinking, both in how to apply it, but also when to
                    use it. I also now have a better understanding of the time, resources, and
                    skills that go into creating a project of this caliber and scale.

                    I created this project during an internship at Zooka Creative, a marketing
                    agency. While I had some smaller projects I worked on at Zooka as well, my
                    biggest focus was creating a few types of in-store displays for an upcoming
                    launch of a solar business for a major company. One display was designed to be
                    thin and manned by an employee and it gave me my first taste of working with a
                    client and their project constraints. When designing this within Rhino, I went
                    through dozens of designs in a very short period of time.

                />
                <p>
                    When going through this process, I made sure to have at least the prior few
                    iterations available at all times, as well as their individual components. This
                    not only enabled me to iterate off of the previous design very easily, but I
                    also was able to grab components from prior designs if I ended up preferring
                    them after all. The second display was more involved and larger, although many
                    of the specific decisions, such as creating a model home, were my own. I went
                    through a similar process as I did with the first design, although I received
                    feedback more often since the design was more involved. The first prototype that
                    I showed off to the client in a meeting was lauded by not only the client, but
                    the rest of my Zooka co-workers. Out of all of the designs shown to the client,
                    mine was selected to be further developed into a full product.

                <p>
                    I continued to develop the prototype on my own as well as work with our content
                    team to add graphics and make appropriate changes to make the display more
                    “store ready”. This involved creating a blueprint that included not only the
                    design at all angles, but an “unfolded” iteration. Although I concluded my
                    internship at Zooka before the project was completed, I last heard that my
                    prototype was intended to be produced into a full model and displayed at the
                    client’s headquarters.

                    During my junior year at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, I was given the
                    opportunity to design something on my own with very few restrictions. I wasn't
                    exactly sure in what space I'd be working, but I knew that I wanted it to
                    involve a controller or handheld device so I could see if they were as enjoyable
                    to design as I hoped they would be. With this in mind, after eight months of on
                    and off work, I created <em>Ludo Learn</em>. <em>Ludo Learn</em> is a system
                    that enables "enhanced education", learning beyond the classroom, in low income,
                    low infrastructure areas.

                <p>
                    Before even beginning work on the design, I did particularly extensive research
                    on educational software and “edutainment”. A large part of this was creating a
                    survey that I sent out to multiple middle school teachers who then shared it
                    with their students, getting hundreds of responses as a result, all of which
                    helped guide my design going forward.

                <p>
                    The hardware went through a few major iterations, with the first couple focusing
                    on putting the functionality of a mouse within the form factor of a handheld. I
                    did this since I wanted it to feel less like a video game system and closer to a
                    traditional computer, but after user feedback and testing, I focused more on the
                    overall shape of the design and only the most important ways the user would
                    interact with the device.

                <p>
                    Throughout the process, I was slowly self-learning some basic electronic skills
                    that would enable me to get the hardware to interface with the software for my
                    final prototype, and after getting the right components and connecting them
                    together in the correct way, I had a fully functioning handheld device.
                    Alongside a friend, I developed some basic software that could run on the device
                    and be demoed, giving a clear picture of what the device would be like.

                    This class project took place over seven weeks, and had a very specific goal: To
                    design a set of three objects which will help prevent burns from coffee spills
                    in the style of designer Joe Colombo. The combination of the COVID-19 lockdown
                    occurring in the middle of this project, as well as my working with a partner
                    for this particular project, resulted in an interesting change of pace compared
                    to my previous design work up to this point. My partner and I were already
                    locked down in our separate homes by the time we created our first physical
                    prototypes, so we could only use pictures to show one another our concepts. We
                    worked on a lid, cup, and coaster combo set that would minimize coffee burns. My
                    partner worked mainly on the cup, and I worked on the other two components, the
                    lid and the coaster.

                <img src="img/Coffee-3.png" class="float-end ms-3" width="225px" />
                <p>
                    In the first iteration, I failed to show one of the key features of the lid
                    component, the liquid retrieval/guard system, and this resulted in subpar
                    feedback from our peers. After this setback, I decided to take a 3D model
                    approach sooner than I had planned, and this was the right call. Despite the
                    much more positive feedback from our peers regarding this second iteration, a
                    change arose that would need to be made to the lid which would require the
                    entire lid to be remade, not just modified or copied. After about an hour, I
                    managed to perfectly replicate the lid and make the change that was needed. This
                    project allowed me to expand and show my proficiency with the Rhino CAD
                    software, especially my ability to relate new aspects of a model to the older
                    ones. This was not only demonstrated when I replicated the lid perfectly, but
                    also when I had to fit the coaster and lid around the cup, which had been made
                    separately from the other two components.

                    Another project from Summer 2024 was to create a gasket cover with one goal in
                    mind: precision. Since gasket covers can be used in a wide array of mechanical
                    designs, including some where errors of a fraction of a millimeter matter,
                    ensuring that the otherwise simple gasket cover has the exact dimensions needed
                    is of the utmost importance. I began by taking a multitude of measurements from
                    the gasket using a caliper, making sure to take each measurement a few times to
                    ensure accuracy. I then created a sketch primarily to note all of my
                    measurements, especially since if I got all of the measurements right, I
                    technically wouldn't even need the sketch, but of course I created one anyway
                    just to keep everything straight.

                <p>
                    I was then able to quickly create a sketch in Solidworks of the gasket cover.
                    After finishing the CAD sketch, I used GibbsCAM to prepare the part for
                    machining in BU's EPIC.

                    Almost immediately after milling the first iteration, I knew something was
                    wrong. I quickly discovered that the holes on the sides were significantly
                    misaligned. This seemed to have something to do with the radius/centering of the
                    circles due to the distance of the misalignment.

                <img src="img/Gasket-6.jpg" class="float-end ms-3 mb-2" width="225px" />
                <p>
                    After noticing my blunder, I quickly corrected the error within the CAD model
                    and returned to EPIC to mill another cover. While this second iteration
                    initially seemed to fit correctly, I later found out I had made two small yet
                    important errors. Firstly, I had made the diameter of the larger circles
                    slightly larger than they were supposed to be. Secondly, when I was correcting
                    the spacing of the side holes, I had still left them slightly too close to each
                    other.

                <p>
                    After taking further measurements and making the necessary modifications, I
                    milled a third and thankfully final iteration of the gasket cover. Overall,
                    considering the speed at which this was completed and accuracy by the end, I
                    think this was a fairly successful project. That being said, it became clear to
                    me that measuring the gasket multiple times wasn't enough, and I should have
                    additionally focused on checking the measurements at each stage of the process,
                    since they may have been recreated slightly incorrectly at one stage in the
                    process and never noticed until it was too late.
