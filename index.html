        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>Throughout the majority of my life, I have known that I wanted to create. When I was younger, I thought that
            being an “inventor” was a legitimate occupation. I eventually realized this was not the case but soon
            learned about the career of product design and it has been my dream job ever since. Because of this, I
            attended college at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute for a human-centered Design, Innovation, Society
            degree. As a result of the increased presence of design in my life while at RPI, I’ve been able to begin to
            narrow down what I enjoy designing the most. One particular product that has fascinated me more and more
            over the years is the video game controller. They are interesting in that they have the ability to control
            thousands of unique games and yet be simple and comfortable enough for anyone to understand and use long
            term. Another more general area I like to work within is designing products that are multi-purpose. I enjoy
            working on products that have multiple functions or forms, that work together to achieve their own smaller
            goals, that also have a larger purpose, such as my SwitchStand, a collapsible design workstation. I am also
            pursuing a dual major in business management. While I consider product design my primary interest, I’ve been
            able to take advantage of skills learned from my business courses, such as marketing and human-focused
            analysis, and apply them to my design work. While I’m fully capable of executing every stage of the design
            process, I consider my strengths to be 3D modeling, rapid prototyping, and being able to make changes on the
            fly. In the future, I hope not only to fine tune my pre-existing skills, but to also develop new skills that
            will give me an even greater understanding of the design process, and to continue to develop more real-world
            products. The following “slices” of my portfolio highlight a portion of my design work over the past four
            years.</p>

        </figure>
        <p>I created my most recent project during an internship at Zooka Creative, a marketing agency. While I had some
            smaller projects I worked on at Zooka as well, my biggest focus was creating a few versions of in-store
            displays for an upcoming launch of a solar business for a major company. One display was designed to be thin
            and manned by an employee and it gave me my first taste of working with a client and their project
            constraints.</p>

        </figure>
        <p>The second display was more involved and larger, although many of the specific decisions, such
            as creating a model home, were my own. The first prototype that I showed off to the client in a meeting was
            lauded by not only the client, but the rest of my Zooka co-workers. Out of all of the designs shown to the
            client, mine was selected to be further developed into a full product. I continued to develop the prototype
            on my own as well as work with our content team to add graphics and make appropriate changes to make the
            display more “store ready”. This involved creating a blueprint that included not only the design at all
            angles, but an “unfolded” iteration. Although I concluded my internship at Zooka before the project was
            completed, I last heard that my prototype was intended to be produced into a full model and displayed at the
            client’s headquarters.</p>

        </figure>
        <p>During my junior year at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, I was given the opportunity to design something on
            my own with very few restrictions. I wasn't exactly sure in what space I'd be working, but I knew that I
            wanted it to involve a controller or handheld device so I could see if they were as enjoyable to design as I
            hoped they would be. After eight months of on and off work, I created my personal favorite project to work
            on so far, <em>Ludo Learn</em>. <em>Ludo Learn</em> is a system that enables "enhanced education", learning
            beyond the
            classroom, in low income and low infrastructure areas. The hardware of <em>Ludo Learn</em> in its current
            state is a
            handheld system that uses interchangeable cartridges for different kinds of educational software. The design
            of the handheld and cartridges means the handheld is very affordable and, while the cartridges will be more
            expensive to purchase, they will be rented or "checked out", like in a library. This process will occur in
            the "Connect Center", which would be a mobile center that not only enables the core idea, but serves other
            functions as well, such as peer-to-peer connectivity. Working on this project resulted in my learning a
            plethora of skills, including some electronics skills and software skills, mainly due to how long it took me
            to develop it and, more importantly, advance the design. I even collaborated with some friends to create a
            software demo as well as iron out some of the kinks in the functioning prototype. The project has also
            solidified my interest in designing controllers, as my favorite part of working on <em>Ludo Learn</em> so
            far has
            been creating the handheld itself.</p>

        </figure>
        <p>This project took place over seven weeks, and had a very specific goal: To design a set of three objects
            which will help prevent burns from coffee, in the style of designer Joe Colombo. The combination of the
            COVID-19 lockdown occurring in the middle of this project, as well as my working with a partner for this
            particular project, resulted in an interesting change of pace compared to my previous design work. My
            partner and I were already locked down in our separate homes by the time we created our first physical
            prototypes, so we could only use pictures to show one another our concepts. We worked on a lid, cup, and
            coaster combo set that would minimize coffee burns. My partner worked mainly on the cup, and I worked on the
            other two components, the lid and the coaster. In the first iteration, I failed to show one of the key
            features of the lid component, the liquid retrieval/guard system, and this resulted in subpar feedback from
            our peers. After this setback, I decided to take a 3D model approach sooner than I had planned, and this was
            the right call. Despite the much more positive feedback from our peers regarding this second iteration, a
            change arose that would need to be made to the lid which would require the entire lid to be remade, not just
            modified or copied. After about an hour, I managed to perfectly replicate the lid and make the change that
            was needed. This project allowed me to expand and show my proficiency with the Rhino CAD software,
            especially my ability to connect new aspects of a model to the older ones. This was not only demonstrated
            when I replicated the lid perfectly, but also when I had to fit the coaster and lid around the cup, which
            had been made separately from the other two components.</p>

        </figure>
        <p>This specific project had a four week time frame. I was asked to design a product to be used by students in
            the design studio space at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Since the product being designed was to be used
            by those designing it, that made the process easier and harder. It was harder, because I had a fairly small
            sample size of people who I had to design for, but it was also easier since I could observe what issues
            people seemed to be having right in front of me, and design based off of that. I noticed a general issue
            regarding organization and decided to work on that issue. I eventually came up with a solution and created a
            design similar to my final design, but without any of the transformation capabilities.</p>

        <p>When I presented my
            pin-ups to some peers, they misinterpreted one of my drawings as a folding mechanism.I realized the benefits
            of this possibility and decided to continue with the same general form but now with a folding feature. Once
            this version was shown to my fellow students, another peer suggested that I make the entire module
            collapsible. Initially, I passed this off as impossible but I decided to draw out some ideas for how this
            would work. After about a day of testing, I realized it was physically possible to make the module
            collapsible and I got to work. I repurposed door hinges and utilized a lot of tape, amongst other
            unconventional methods, and I managed to put together a fully collapsible prototype. This project in
            particular tested my material resourcefulness and ability to expand upon the current version of a design,
            while still keeping the core concept intact and without the need for serious revision.</p>

            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>For this project, I was given the prompt of designing for play. This was an intentionally broad prompt so,
            instead of going with a more traditional meaning, I decided to focus on playing with musical instruments.
            Considering my time constraint of five days, I knew that I would have to 3D print to get a working design in
            the time period.I made sure from the start to work in a smaller space, as well as to solidify a core idea
            that I would try to stick to. This resulted in the <em>SoundBox</em>, a practice device that can be used percussively
            and have its pitch modified. The time constraint meant that I would only have one attempt at a revised model
            after my first prototype so I made sure to apply as much feedback as possible to my second prototype,
            without going too far away from the core concept. Despite some modeling challenges, and some work after
            hours, I was able to create a second iteration that fixed all of the major issues with the first iteration.
            After all was said and done, amongst all of the participants with the same prompt and time constraint, I
            managed to get the only working prototype after five days. The process I used for that design, combined with
            my dedication to the project, allowed my workflow to be efficient and effective.</p>
